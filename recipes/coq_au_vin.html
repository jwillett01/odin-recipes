        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken in Red Wine with Onions, Mushrooms, and Bacon</p>
        <p>This popular dish may be called <em>coq au Chambertin, coq au riesling,</em> or <em>coq au</em> whatever wine you use for its cooking. It is made with
        either white or red wine but the red is more characteristic. In France it is usually accompanied only by parsley potatoes; buttered green peas could be 
        included if you wish a green vegetable. Serve with it a young, full-bodied red Burgundy, Beaujolais, or Cotes du Rhone.</p>
        <p><em>For 4 to 6 people</em></p>

            <li>1 1/4 pts. young, full-bodied red wine such as Burgundy, Beaujolais, Cotes du Rhone, or Chianti</li>
            <li>1/2 to 3/4 pt. brown chick stock, brown stock, or beef bouillon</li>
            <li>1 dsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cloves mashed garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp thyme</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>12 to 24 brown-braised onions</li>
            <li>1/2 lb, sauteed mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 oz. flour</li>
            <li>Sprigs of fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the rind and cut the bacon into <em>lardons</em> (rectangles 1/4 inch across and 1 inch long). Simmer for 10 minutes in 2 quarts of water. Rinse in 
            cold water. Dry</li>
            <li>Saute the bacon slowly in hot butter until it is very lightly browned. Remove to a side dish.</li>
            <li>Dry the chicken thoroughly. Brown it in the hot fat in the casserole.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken. Return the bacon to the casserole with the chicken. Cover and cook slowly for 10 minutes, turning the chicken once.</li>
            <li>Uncover, and pour in the cognac. Averting your face, ignite the cognac with a lighted match. Shake the casserole back and forth for several seconds
                until the flames subside.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the wine into the casserole. Add just enough stock or bouillon to cover the chicken. Stir in the tomato paste, garlic and herbs. Bring to simmering
                point. Cover and simmer slowly for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and its juices run a clear yellow when the meat is pricked with a fork.
                Remove the chicken to a side dish.
            </li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, prepare the onions and mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Simmer the chicken cooking liquid in the casserole for a minute or two, skimming off fat. Then raise heat and boil rapidly, reducing the liquid to about
                1 pint. Correct seasoning. Remove from heat, and discard bay leaf.
            </li>
            <li>Blend the butter and flour together into a smooth paste (<em>beurre manie</em>) on a saucer with a spatula. Beat the paste into the hot liquid with a wire
                whisk. Bring to a simmering point, stirring, and simmer for a minute or two. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon lightly.
            </li>
            <li>Arrange the chicken in the casserole, place the mushrooms and onions around it, and baste with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Shortly before serving, bring to simmering point, basting the chicken with the sauce. Cover an simmer slowly for 4 to 5 minutes, until the chicken is 
                hot through.
            </li>
            <li>Serve from the casserole, or arrange on a hot dish. Decorate with sprigs of parsley.</li>
