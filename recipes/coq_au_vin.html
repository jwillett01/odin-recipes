        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken in Red Wine with Onions, Mushrooms, and Bacon</p>
        <p>This popular dish may be called <em>coq au Chambertin, coq au riesling,</em> or <em>coq au</em> whatever wine you use for its cooking. It is made with
        either white or red wine but the red is more characteristic. In France it is usually accompanied only by parsley potatoes; buttered green peas could be 
        included if you wish a green vegetable. Serve with it a young, full-bodied red Burgundy, Beaujolais, or Cotes du Rhone.</p>
