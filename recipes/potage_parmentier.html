        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>Leek or Onion and Potato Soup</em></p>
        <p>Leek and potato soup smells good, tastes good, and is simplicity itself to make. It is also versatile as a soup base; add watercress and you have a 
            watercress soup, or stir in cream and chill it for a <em>vichyssoise</em>. To change the formula a bit, add carrots, string beans, cauliflower, broccoli, 
            or anything else you think would go with it, and vary the proportions as you wish.
        </p>
        <p><em>For about 3 pints, serving 6 to 8 people</em></p>
